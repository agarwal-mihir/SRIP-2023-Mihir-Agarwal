# SRIP-2023-Mihir-Agarwal

I am Mihir Agarwal, a second year undergrduate at IIT Gandhinagar. This is my submission for the SRIP programme 2023 at IIT Gandhinagar.

The questions have been arranged in the respective folders.


- [x] Q1
- [x] Q2
- [x] Q3
- [x] Q4 (Active Learning Implementation not completed)
- [x] Q5
- [x] Q6 (Only Reverse KL - Divergence has been implemented)
- [ ] Q7


The code for Q4 has been written on kaggle, as fastai library runs into various issues on the my local system (Mac m1)

I have used the following resources as reference:

- Probabilistic Machine Learning: An Introduction by Kevin Murphy
- Practical Deep Learning for Coders by FastAI 
- Pytorch Documentation
- JAX Documentation
- OpenAq Documentation
- ChatGPT (Helped to write latex, and helped with errors in the code)
